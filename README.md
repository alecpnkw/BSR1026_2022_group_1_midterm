Reproducible code document for Group #1 midterm as part of BSR1026, Spring 2022. 

The file `midterm.Rmd` contains all R and python code used in analyses for our midterm project focused on 
the associations between PCLO mutation status and epidemiologic variables in a dataset from the TCGA of 
liver cancer cases. 

### Installation

Run using R version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01)

The following R packages must be installed:

- dplyr
- tidyr
- ggplot2
- ggstatsplot
- graphics
- ggpubr
- moonBook
- webr
- plotly
- pastecs
- corrplot
- tableone
- sjPlot
- openxlsx
- readxl
- readr
- reticulate
- knitr

Using conda (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), create a conda environment using the supplied .yaml file: 

```{bash}
conda env create --file conda-env.yaml
```

Now all elements of the `midterm.Rmd` will be executable.
